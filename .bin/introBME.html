      <h1>Welcome to the BlackMarlinExec!</h1>
      <p><b>( Seven Degrees of Domain Admin ). BME's a tool used to enumerate, attack, or poisoning target<br>
        inside an Active Directory environment and networks.</b></p>
      <p>BME uses graph and analysis theory to reveal the hidden and unintended relationships within an Active Directory or Active Environment.<br> 
        Security can use BlackMarlinExec to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify.<br> 
        It also has it's own attack path management that continuously maps and quantifies Active Directory attack paths. CS can see thousand,<br> 
        even millions of attack paths within your existing architecture.</p>

        <p><b>TCP Killer</b></p>
          <p>Barracuda is a utility to kill all TCP connections on a network. It works by intercepting network traffic, and forging RST packets of existing<br> 
          connections to cause hangups. Works for both IPv4 connections and IPv6. Barracuda ( TCPkiller ) is a sneaky way to kill network connections.</p>
        <p>Any targeted system will appear to work when examined through typical diagnostics - DNS will resolve, ICMP's will go through, and the network<br>
          card will be able to connect ( slow ) to the network-but no TCP connections will be sustained.</p>
